            <h2>Scope of Services</h2>
            <p>
                In support of the educational goals of the University and the Division of Student Life, Counseling and
                Psychological Services (CAPS) provides a range of clinical, preventative, and training services
                consistent with the practices and standards of a nationally accredited university counseling center.
                CAPS is committed to creating a safe and supportive environment based on our multicultural,
                multi-disciplinary and multi-theoretical values and practices that allow our diverse student body to
                access care, to receive high quality services, and to take positive pathways to mental health.
            </p>
            <h3>Clinical Services</h3>
            <p>CAPS licensed therapists provide confidential clinical services for eligible U of M undergraduate and
                graduate students. We strive to provide services in an inclusive atmosphere that is welcoming,
                comfortable, and multiculturally sensitive for all students.

                Mental health therapy goes by different names including counseling, psychotherapy, talk therapy, and
                supportive counseling. It is a collaborative process between a client and counselor that begins with
                establishing a trusting and respectful relationship in a caring and nonjudgmental environment. Together
                the client and counselor explore the clientâ€™s concerns and develop mutually agreed upon goals for
                therapy. Some typical goals include:

                Furthermore, CAPS has established several multidisciplinary teams to support students that experience
                specific concerns (i.e., Eating Issues Network [EIN]; Gender Affirming Care Team; Survivor Support Team
                [SST]).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identifying and changing patterns of thinking or believing that hinder personal and academic success
                    or create and maintain problem situations</li>
                <li>Deepening understanding of oneself</li>
                <li>Discovering and developing personal strengths</li>
                <li>Developing or regaining a sense of control and pleasure in life</li>
                <li>Developing or improving coping skills</li>
                <li>Asking for help and support from friends, family, and other campus resources</li>
                <li>Creating a greater understanding of oneself in relationships with others</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Crisis Services</h3>
            <p>CAPS clinicians are available for students needing immediate, same-day access to a mental health
                professional during our business hours. Reasons to meet with a Counselor on Duty include, but are not
                limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If a student is not feeling safe</li>
                <li>If a student has to make a difficult decision in the next 2-3 days</li>
                <li>If a student has been sexually assaulted within the past 72 hours</li>
                <li>If a student has been experiencing a lot of stress for a long time and feels like they urgently need
                    to speak to someonek</li>
                <li>If a student has experienced a sudden or unexpected loss</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Consultation</h3>
            <p>CAPS provides consultation services to faculty, staff, students, campus partners, parents, and community
                providers regarding mental health concerns. Early identification of concerns and appropriate
                intervention can better assist connecting students with needed services. CAPS provides consultation
                services both through the Counselor on Duty and through liaison relationships with departments,
                programs, schools, and colleges across campus.</p>
