            <h2>Our Services</h2>
            <p>At the University of Michigan, we recognize there is no “one size fits all” approach to supporting
                student mental health. That's why we provide a variety of options to meet a diversity of needs. Check
                out the options listed below to see what may be a good fit for you.

                Most of you know that individual counseling is one option -- but we know that not everyone wants or
                needs individual therapy with a professional -- so we've created other options which are noted below
                with a brief description to help you decide what route you may want to take.

                If you are not sure, please consult with us and we'll help you decide.</p>
